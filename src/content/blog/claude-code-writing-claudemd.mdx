CLAUDE.md is a file that tells Claude about your project. A good one makes Claude more helpful. A bad one wastes tokens and confuses things.

## What CLAUDE.md Does

When you start Claude Code in a directory with CLAUDE.md, it automatically reads it. This gives Claude:

- Project context
- Tech stack info
- Coding conventions
- Common commands
- Important file locations

## Where to Put It

Place `CLAUDE.md` in your project root:

```
my-project/
├── CLAUDE.md          ← Here
├── package.json
├── src/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

You can also have subdirectory-specific files:

```
my-project/
├── CLAUDE.md              ← Global project info
├── src/
│   └── CLAUDE.md          ← Frontend-specific info
└── server/
    └── CLAUDE.md          ← Backend-specific info
```

## Basic Structure

Start simple:

```markdown
# Project Name

## Tech Stack
- Framework: Next.js 14
- Language: TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL
- ORM: Prisma

## Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run lint` - Run linter

## Project Structure
- `src/app/` - Next.js app router pages
- `src/components/` - React components
- `src/lib/` - Utility functions
- `prisma/` - Database schema and migrations
```

## What to Include

### Essential: Commands

Claude needs to know how to run things:

```markdown
## Commands
- `npm run dev` - Development server (port 3000)
- `npm test` - Jest tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Tests in watch mode
- `npm run lint` - ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` - TypeScript check
```

### Essential: Code Style

Prevent style arguments:

```markdown
## Code Style
- Use functional components, not class components
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
```

### Useful: Architecture Overview

Help Claude understand the structure:

```markdown
## Architecture
- API routes in `src/app/api/`
- Shared components in `src/components/ui/`
- Business logic in `src/lib/`
- Database queries in `src/db/`
```

### Useful: Common Patterns

Show Claude how you do things:

```markdown
## Patterns

### API Route Pattern
```typescript
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  try {
    const data = await fetchData();
    return Response.json(data);
  } catch (error) {
    return Response.json({ error: 'Failed' }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

### Component Pattern
```typescript
interface Props {
  title: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export function Card({ title, children }: Props) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```
```

### Optional: Key Files

Point to important files:

```markdown
## Key Files
- `src/lib/auth.ts` - Authentication logic
- `src/lib/db.ts` - Database connection
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template
```

## What NOT to Include

### Too much detail

```markdown
# Bad: Too verbose
This project was started in 2021 by the engineering team to solve
the problem of customer onboarding. We went through several iterations
and finally settled on Next.js because...

# Good: Just the facts
## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14
- TypeScript
```

### Obvious information

```markdown
# Bad: Stating the obvious
JavaScript files end in .js
React components return JSX

# Good: Project-specific info
Components use CSS Modules (*.module.css)
```

### Outdated information

Keep CLAUDE.md current. Outdated info confuses Claude:

```markdown
# Bad: Outdated
We use React 16  ← Actually using React 18

# Good: Current
We use React 18 with Server Components
```

### Sensitive information

Never put secrets in CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
# Bad: Security risk
API_KEY=sk-12345

# Good: Reference .env
See .env.example for required environment variables
```

## Real Example

Here's a complete, practical CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
# E-Commerce API

## Tech Stack
- Node.js 20
- Express
- TypeScript
- PostgreSQL + Prisma
- Jest for testing

## Commands
npm run dev       # Start with hot reload
npm run build     # Compile TypeScript
npm test          # Run all tests
npm run migrate   # Run database migrations

## Project Structure
src/
├── routes/       # Express route handlers
├── services/     # Business logic
├── models/       # Prisma model extensions
├── middleware/   # Auth, validation, etc.
└── utils/        # Helper functions

## Code Conventions
- Services handle business logic, routes handle HTTP
- All endpoints return { data, error, meta } format
- Use Zod for request validation
- Errors thrown in services, caught in routes

## Testing
- Unit tests: `*.test.ts` next to source files
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/`
- Run specific test: `npm test -- auth`

## Environment
Copy .env.example to .env for local development.
Required: DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET
```

## Tips for Better CLAUDE.md

### 1. Start small, add as needed

Begin with commands and tech stack. Add more when Claude asks questions or makes mistakes.

### 2. Update it regularly

When you change patterns or add tools, update CLAUDE.md.

### 3. Be specific about preferences

```markdown
# Vague
Use good naming conventions

# Specific
- Variables: camelCase
- Components: PascalCase
- Files: kebab-case
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
```

### 4. Include examples for complex patterns

If you have non-obvious patterns, show don't tell:

```markdown
## Error Handling

Always use our custom error class:

```typescript
throw new AppError('User not found', 404, 'USER_NOT_FOUND');
```
```

### 5. Reference other documentation

```markdown
## More Info
- API docs: docs/api.md
- Database schema: prisma/schema.prisma
- Deployment: docs/deployment.md
```

## Verifying It Works

After creating CLAUDE.md, test it:

```
What tech stack does this project use?
What command runs the tests?
Show me the code style conventions for this project.
```

Claude should answer from your CLAUDE.md without reading other files.
