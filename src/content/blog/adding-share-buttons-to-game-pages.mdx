Wanted to add share buttons to all my game pages today. Initially overthought it with result-sharing, image cards, SDK integrations... then realized I just needed a simple "share this game" button.

## The setup

My blog has 20 mini-games (Snake, 2048, Flappy Bird, etc.) served through Astro's dynamic routing:

```
src/pages/[lang]/games/[slug].astro
```

One file generates all 60 pages (20 games × 3 languages).

## Making ShareButton multilingual

Already had a `ShareButton.tsx` but it was Korean-only. Added a simple translation object:

```tsx
type Language = 'ko' | 'en' | 'ja';

const translations = {
  ko: { share: '공유', copied: '복사됨!', copyLink: '링크 복사', kakao: '카카오톡' },
  en: { share: 'Share', copied: 'Copied!', copyLink: 'Copy Link', kakao: 'KakaoTalk' },
  ja: { share: 'シェア', copied: 'コピー!', copyLink: 'リンクコピー', kakao: 'カカオトーク' },
};

interface ShareButtonProps {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  url?: string;
  lang?: Language;  // added this
}
```

Then replaced hardcoded strings with `{t.share}`, `{t.copied}`, etc.

## Adding to all games at once

Since all games use `[slug].astro`, I just added the import and component once:

```astro
---
import ShareButton from '../../../components/tools/ShareButton';
---

<div class="flex items-center justify-center gap-3 mb-2">
  <h1 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold">
    {seo.title.split(' - ')[0]}
  </h1>
  <ShareButton
    client:load
    title={seo.title}
    description={seo.description}
    lang={lang}
  />
</div>
```

That's it. All 20 games now have share buttons in 3 languages.

## Quick test

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:4321/ko/games/snake | grep -o '공유'
# 공유

curl -s http://localhost:4321/en/games/snake | grep -o 'Share'
# Share

curl -s http://localhost:4321/ja/games/snake | grep -o 'シェア'
# シェア
```

## Takeaway

Dynamic routing is great for this stuff. Instead of editing 20 files, I edited 2 (ShareButton + [slug].astro) and got multilingual share buttons everywhere.
