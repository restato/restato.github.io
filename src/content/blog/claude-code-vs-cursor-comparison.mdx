Both Claude Code and Cursor are AI-powered coding tools, but they work very differently. Here's an honest breakdown to help you choose.

## The Core Difference

**Cursor** is an IDE (forked from VS Code) with AI built in. You work in a graphical editor, and AI assists you there.

**Claude Code** is a CLI tool. You work in the terminal, and Claude operates on your files directly through commands.

## When to Use Cursor

### You prefer visual editing

Cursor gives you:
- Syntax highlighting
- Visual file explorer
- Inline diffs for AI changes
- Click-to-apply suggestions

### You're new to AI coding tools

The visual interface makes it easier to:
- See what changes AI is proposing
- Accept or reject individual edits
- Understand the AI's reasoning

### You work mostly in one file at a time

Cursor excels at:
- Single-file refactoring
- Code completion
- Inline chat about specific lines

### Your team uses VS Code

Since Cursor is a VS Code fork:
- Extensions mostly work
- Settings transfer over
- Familiar keybindings

## When to Use Claude Code

### You prefer terminal workflows

Claude Code is for developers who:
- Live in the terminal
- Use tmux, neovim, or similar tools
- Want AI that fits existing workflows

### You're doing multi-file operations

Claude Code handles complex tasks:
- Codebase-wide refactors
- Creating multiple related files
- Understanding project architecture

### You need automation

Claude Code runs headless:
```bash
claude --headless "fix all TypeScript errors"
```

Use it in CI/CD, scripts, or scheduled tasks.

### You want git-aware AI

Claude Code:
- Creates checkpoints automatically
- Understands your git history
- Can create commits and PRs

### You're working with large codebases

The CLI approach scales:
- No IDE memory overhead
- Parallel exploration with subagents
- Works over SSH on remote machines

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Claude Code | Cursor |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Interface | Terminal | GUI (VS Code fork) |
| Learning curve | Steeper | Gentler |
| Multi-file edits | Excellent | Good |
| Code completion | No | Yes |
| Inline suggestions | No | Yes |
| Git integration | Deep | Basic |
| Automation/CI | Yes | Limited |
| Custom commands | Yes (Skills) | Limited |
| Remote/SSH | Excellent | Needs setup |
| Price | Usage-based | $20/mo + usage |

## Pricing Comparison

**Cursor:**
- Free tier with limits
- Pro: $20/month (includes some AI usage)
- Additional usage billed

**Claude Code:**
- Uses Anthropic API directly
- Pay per token used
- No monthly subscription (just API costs)

For heavy users, Claude Code can cost more or less depending on usage patterns. Light users might find Cursor's flat rate simpler.

## Accuracy and Quality

Both use Claude models (Cursor can also use GPT-4). The main differences:

**Cursor** has specialized prompts for:
- Code completion
- Inline edits
- Tab-to-accept flows

**Claude Code** has better:
- Project-wide understanding
- Multi-step task execution
- System-level operations

For pure code generation quality, they're comparable. For complex reasoning and multi-file tasks, Claude Code often produces more coherent results.

## Can You Use Both?

Yes. Many developers use:
- **Cursor** for day-to-day editing and quick completions
- **Claude Code** for complex refactors, automation, and CLI tasks

They don't conflict. You can have Cursor open while running Claude Code in a terminal.

## My Recommendation

**Start with Cursor if:**
- You're new to AI coding
- You prefer visual interfaces
- You mainly work on single files

**Start with Claude Code if:**
- You're comfortable in the terminal
- You do complex, multi-file work
- You want automation capabilities

**Use both if:**
- You have the budget
- You work on varied tasks
- You want the best tool for each situation

## Switching Between Them

If you start with one and want to try the other:

**Cursor to Claude Code:**
- Learn basic terminal navigation
- Set up your CLAUDE.md for project context
- Start with simple tasks before complex ones

**Claude Code to Cursor:**
- Install Cursor (it imports VS Code settings)
- Learn Cmd+K (inline edit) and Cmd+L (chat)
- Get comfortable with inline diffs

## The Bottom Line

They're different tools for different workflows. The "better" one depends entirely on how you work. Try both for a week each and see which fits your style.
