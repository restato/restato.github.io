You've installed Claude Code. Now what? This guide walks you through the first session and essential configuration.

## Starting Your First Session

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
claude
```

You'll see an interactive prompt. Type your first message:

```
Hello! What can you help me with?
```

Claude will explain its capabilities. Try something practical:

```
List all files in the current directory
```

## Understanding the Interface

The Claude Code interface has several parts:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Claude Code                    [tokens: 5k] │  ← Status bar
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                             │
│ [Your conversation appears here]            │  ← Conversation area
│                                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ >                                           │  ← Input prompt
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The status bar shows:
- Token usage
- Current model
- Session info

## First-Time Permissions

Claude Code asks permission before:
- Reading files
- Writing files
- Running commands
- Accessing the network

For each request, you'll see:

```
Claude wants to: Read file src/index.ts
Allow? (y/n/always)
```

Options:
- `y` - Allow this one time
- `n` - Deny this request
- `always` - Always allow this type of action

For trusted projects, you can be more permissive. For sensitive code, be more careful.

## Essential Slash Commands

Slash commands are shortcuts for common actions:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show all available commands |
| `/clear` | Clear the conversation |
| `/compact` | Summarize and reduce context |
| `/model` | Switch between models |
| `/exit` | Exit Claude Code |

Try them:

```
/help
```

## Setting Up Your Project

Navigate to a project directory and start Claude Code there:

```bash
cd ~/projects/my-app
claude
```

Now Claude can see and work with your project files.

### Create a CLAUDE.md File

This file tells Claude about your project. Create one:

```
Create a CLAUDE.md file for this project with basic information
```

Or manually create `CLAUDE.md` in your project root:

```markdown
# My App

## Tech Stack
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Node.js 20

## Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm test` - Run tests

## Code Style
- Use functional components
- Prefer named exports
- Follow existing patterns
```

Claude will read this automatically and follow your guidelines.

## Basic Workflows

### Read and understand code

```
Explain what the src/utils/auth.ts file does
```

### Make changes

```
Add error handling to the login function in src/auth.ts
```

### Run commands

```
Run the tests and show me any failures
```

### Ask questions

```
How does the routing work in this app?
```

## Session Management

### Named sessions

Start a named session:

```bash
claude --session "fixing-login-bug"
```

### Resume a session

```bash
claude --resume
```

### List sessions

```bash
claude sessions list
```

## Choosing the Right Model

Claude Code supports multiple models:

| Model | Best for |
|-------|---------|
| Sonnet | General tasks (default) |
| Haiku | Quick, simple tasks |
| Opus | Complex reasoning |

Switch models:

```
/model haiku
```

Or:

```
/model opus
```

## Important Settings

### View current settings

```bash
claude config show
```

### Common settings to adjust

**Theme:**
```bash
claude config set theme dark
```

**Default model:**
```bash
claude config set model sonnet
```

## Getting Help

Inside Claude Code:
```
/help
```

For documentation:
```
What are all the things you can do?
```

## Practice Tasks

Try these to get comfortable:

1. **Explore:** "What files are in this project?"
2. **Read:** "Show me the main entry point"
3. **Explain:** "How does [some feature] work?"
4. **Write:** "Add a comment explaining this function"
5. **Run:** "Run the linter and show any issues"

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### Being too vague

```
# Too vague
Fix the bug

# Better
Fix the null pointer error in the handleSubmit function in Form.tsx
```

### Not providing context

```
# Missing context
Update the API

# Better
Update the /users endpoint to return pagination metadata
```

### Forgetting to save work

Claude Code creates git checkpoints, but verify changes are saved:

```
Show me what files have been modified
```

## Next Steps

Now that you're set up:
1. Create a CLAUDE.md for your project
2. Learn keyboard shortcuts
3. Try more complex tasks
4. Explore slash commands

The more you use it, the more natural it becomes.
