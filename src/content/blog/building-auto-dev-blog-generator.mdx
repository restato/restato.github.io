Wanted a way to document my dev work without spending hours writing blog posts. Ended up building an automated generator using Claude Code skills.

## The problem

After coding sessions, I'd have useful knowledge to share but writing it up felt like a chore. Plus when I did write, it either sounded too robotic (AI-generated vibes) or took forever to make it natural.

Needed something that could:
- Turn conversations into posts automatically
- Sound like I actually wrote it
- Work for study groups and helping others learn
- Be in English for wider reach

## What I built

Created a Claude Code skill that analyzes conversations and generates blog posts. It's a slash command that does everything:

```bash
/post
```

That's it. It reads the conversation, extracts what matters, writes a post, and pushes to GitHub.

## How it works

The skill lives in my dotfiles:

```
~/.claude/skills/write-devlog/
├── SKILL.md       # Main logic
└── config.json    # Blog repo settings
```

### Config setup

Points to my Astro blog repo:

```json
{
  "blog": {
    "repo_path": "/Users/direcision/Workspace/ww/restato.github.io",
    "posts_dir": "src/content/blog",
    "remote": "origin",
    "branch": "main"
  },
  "defaults": {
    "language": "en",
    "writing_style": "casual_personal",
    "hide_ai_traces": true
  }
}
```

### The skill logic

SKILL.md tells Claude how to:

1. **Analyze conversations** - Pull out code snippets, problems solved, concepts learned
2. **Generate natural text** - Use phrases like "I tried", "turns out", "spent 2 hours on this"
3. **Variable structure** - Not every post needs the same sections
4. **Remove AI hints** - No "Co-Authored-By", no perfect formatting
5. **Auto-publish** - Create MDX, commit, push to GitHub

Key part was making it sound human. The skill uses casual language and includes struggle:

```markdown
# Good examples from the skill:
- "Ran into this error..."
- "Spent 2 hours debugging before realizing..."
- "Got frustrated with X"
- "Here's what worked"
```

## Things to know

You'll need:
- Astro blog (or adapt for other static sites)
- Claude Code CLI
- Blog repo locally cloned
- Git configured

The skill generates MDX with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Generated Title"
description: "One sentence summary"
date: 2026-01-13
tags: ["tech", "tags"]
---
```

## Gotchas

**AI detection was the big one.** First version sounded too perfect. Had to explicitly tell the skill to:
- Vary post structure
- Use conversational transitions
- Show personality and struggle
- Allow minor imperfections
- Never add "Co-Authored-By" or similar

Also realized every post having the exact same sections screams AI. Now it picks sections based on content - sometimes includes "Prerequisites", sometimes "Gotchas", sometimes neither.

**File naming** - Convert titles to kebab-case, handle collisions with timestamps:

```javascript
"Building Auto Generator" → "building-auto-generator.mdx"
// If exists: "building-auto-generator-1432.mdx"
```

## What it generates

Posts include:
- Natural intro (what you did and why)
- Core "What I did" section
- Optional sections: Quick summary, Prerequisites, Gotchas, Links
- Casual outro when it makes sense

All in English, all sounding like a person wrote it while coding.

## The workflow

```bash
# Work on something
# Have conversation with Claude
# When done:
/post

# Output:
# - Analyzes conversation
# - Generates post
# - Commits: "Building Auto Generator"
# - Pushes to main
# - Shows GitHub + live URLs
```

Takes about 30 seconds, then it's live.

## Why this approach

Tried a few things before this:

1. **Manual writing** - Too slow, often didn't do it
2. **AI with heavy editing** - Still took forever to make it natural
3. **Templates** - Everything looked the same (AI vibes)

This works because it generates variable content that adapts to each conversation. No two posts are identical in structure.

## Next steps

Might add:
- Preview mode before publishing
- Series support (Part 1/2/3)
- Difficulty tags (beginner/advanced)

But keeping it simple for now. It works, posts get published, people can learn from them.
