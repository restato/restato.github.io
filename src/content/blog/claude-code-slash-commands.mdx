Slash commands are shortcuts for common tasks. Create custom ones to automate your specific workflows.

## Built-in Commands

Claude Code includes these by default:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation |
| `/compact` | Reduce context size |
| `/model` | Switch models |
| `/exit` | Exit Claude Code |

## Creating Custom Commands

### Project commands

Create `.claude/commands/` in your project:

```
.claude/
└── commands/
    ├── test.md
    ├── deploy.md
    └── review.md
```

### Command file format

Each `.md` file defines a command:

```markdown
---
name: test
description: Run tests for changed files
---

Run tests for files changed since the last commit:

1. Get list of changed files with `git diff --name-only HEAD~1`
2. Run `npm test -- --findRelatedTests` for those files
3. Report any failures
```

Now use it:
```
/test
```

## Command Examples

### /deploy

```markdown
---
name: deploy
description: Deploy to production
---

Deploy the application:

1. Run `npm run build`
2. Run `npm test`
3. If both pass, run `./scripts/deploy.sh`
4. Report the deployment status
```

### /review

```markdown
---
name: review
description: Review staged changes
---

Review the staged git changes:

1. Run `git diff --staged`
2. Check for:
   - Potential bugs
   - Security issues
   - Missing tests
   - Code style problems
3. Provide specific feedback for each issue found
```

### /component

```markdown
---
name: component
description: Create a new React component
arguments:
  - name: componentName
    description: Name of the component
    required: true
---

Create a new React component called {{componentName}}:

1. Create `src/components/{{componentName}}/{{componentName}}.tsx`
2. Create `src/components/{{componentName}}/{{componentName}}.module.css`
3. Create `src/components/{{componentName}}/{{componentName}}.test.tsx`
4. Export from `src/components/index.ts`

Use our standard component template with TypeScript.
```

Usage:
```
/component UserProfile
```

### /fix-imports

```markdown
---
name: fix-imports
description: Clean up imports in changed files
---

Fix imports in all modified files:

1. Get modified files with `git status --short`
2. For each file:
   - Remove unused imports
   - Sort imports alphabetically
   - Group: external, then internal, then relative
3. Run `npm run lint -- --fix`
```

## Commands with Arguments

Define arguments in frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: create-api
description: Create a new API endpoint
arguments:
  - name: method
    description: HTTP method (get, post, put, delete)
    required: true
  - name: path
    description: API path (e.g., /users)
    required: true
---

Create a new {{method}} endpoint at {{path}}:

1. Create handler in `src/api/{{path}}.ts`
2. Add route to `src/api/routes.ts`
3. Create tests in `src/api/{{path}}.test.ts`
4. Update API documentation
```

Usage:
```
/create-api post /users/login
```

## Personal Commands

Create user-wide commands in `~/.claude/commands/`:

```
~/.claude/
└── commands/
    ├── standup.md
    └── timesheet.md
```

These work in all projects.

## Command Organization

### By workflow

```
.claude/commands/
├── dev/
│   ├── start.md
│   ├── test.md
│   └── lint.md
├── git/
│   ├── commit.md
│   ├── pr.md
│   └── review.md
└── docs/
    ├── api.md
    └── readme.md
```

### Naming conventions

- Use lowercase
- Use hyphens for multi-word: `/fix-types`
- Keep names short but descriptive

## Listing Custom Commands

See all available commands:

```
/help
```

Or:

```
What custom commands are available?
```

## Command Best Practices

### 1. Keep commands focused

```markdown
# Good - single purpose
---
name: lint
---
Run linter and fix issues automatically.

# Bad - too many things
---
name: do-everything
---
Run linter, tests, build, deploy, and update docs.
```

### 2. Include error handling

```markdown
---
name: deploy
---

Deploy the application:

1. Run `npm test`
2. If tests fail, stop and report errors
3. Run `npm run build`
4. If build fails, stop and report errors
5. Deploy only if both pass
```

### 3. Be explicit about steps

```markdown
---
name: pr
---

Create a pull request:

1. Check current branch is not main
2. Push current branch to origin
3. Create PR with title from last commit message
4. Add appropriate labels based on changed files
5. Return the PR URL
```

### 4. Reference project conventions

```markdown
---
name: component
---

Create component following our conventions in CLAUDE.md:
- Use functional components
- Use CSS modules
- Include tests
- Export from index
```

## Debugging Commands

### Test a command

```
Run /test in dry-run mode - show what you would do without doing it
```

### Check command loading

```
List all loaded commands and their sources
```

## Quick Reference

```markdown
# .claude/commands/my-command.md

---
name: my-command
description: What it does
arguments:
  - name: arg1
    description: First argument
    required: true
  - name: arg2
    description: Optional argument
    required: false
---

Instructions for Claude:

1. Step one with {{arg1}}
2. Step two with {{arg2}}
3. Final step
```

| Location | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| `.claude/commands/` | Project only |
| `~/.claude/commands/` | All projects |
