Spent today improving my Claude Code workflow. The old `/git-sync` skill was doing too much at once - commit, push, and PR all in one shot. No way to save work in progress without pushing everything.

## The problem

My old workflow:

```
work → /git-sync → commit + push + PR (all at once)
              ↓
         merge PR (manual)
              ↓
         create new branch (manual) ← annoying
              ↓
         continue working...
```

Two issues:
1. Can't commit intermediate progress without pushing
2. After merging a PR, I had to manually create a new branch

## What I built

Split it into two skills:

### `/commit` - Save work in progress

```bash
# If on main/master, auto-creates branch based on changes
# Then commits

git checkout -b feat/add-login-auth  # auto-generated
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: add login authentication"
```

The branch name is generated from the changes - analyzes files and picks an appropriate `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/` prefix.

### `/pr` - Ship it

```bash
# Push, create PR, merge, then prepare next branch
git push -u origin feat/add-login-auth
gh pr create --title "feat: add login auth" --base main
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
# Ready for next /commit
```

The key improvement: after merging, it automatically switches back to main and pulls. So when I run `/commit` next time, it creates a fresh branch from the latest main.

## The new cycle

```
work → /commit → branch created + committed (local only)
  ↓
work → /commit → another commit stacked
  ↓
work → /commit → keep going...
  ↓
/pr → push + PR + merge + ready for next cycle
  ↓
/commit → new branch from fresh main
```

No more manual branch management. The workflow just loops.

## Bonus: Token savings

While at it, converted all my skills to English. Korean uses way more tokens - each character can be multiple tokens. Same content in English uses roughly 7x fewer tokens.

```json
// Before
"description": "변경사항을 커밋합니다"  // ~15 tokens

// After
"description": "Commit changes"  // ~2 tokens
```

Added this to my CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## Skills Writing Rules
- Always write skills in English for token efficiency
```

## Files changed

- Deleted: `skills/git-sync/`
- Added: `skills/commit/SKILL.md`
- Added: `skills/pr/SKILL.md`
- Updated: All skills converted to English

The workflow feels much smoother now. Intermediate commits without the pressure to push, and no manual cleanup after merging PRs.
