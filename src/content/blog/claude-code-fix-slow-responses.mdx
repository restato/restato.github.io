Claude Code responses should be fast. If you're waiting 30+ seconds regularly, something's wrong.

## Common Causes

### 1. Context bloat

The most common cause. Your session has accumulated too much context.

**Symptoms:**
- Responses get slower over time
- Started fast, now slow
- Been in session for 1+ hours

**Fix:**
```
/compact
```

Or start a fresh session.

### 2. Large file reads

Reading huge files slows everything down.

**Symptoms:**
- Slow after reading specific files
- Working with large codebases

**Fix:**
Read selectively:
```
# Instead of
Read the entire database.ts file

# Do this
Read lines 100-200 of database.ts
```

### 3. Network issues

Your connection to Anthropic's servers is slow.

**Symptoms:**
- Slow from session start
- Other internet services also slow
- Timeouts

**Fix:**
```bash
# Test API directly
time curl -s https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","max_tokens":10,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'
```

If slow, check your network or try a VPN.

### 4. Rate limiting

You're hitting API limits.

**Symptoms:**
- Intermittent slowness
- Sometimes fast, sometimes very slow
- 429 errors appear

**Fix:**
- Wait and retry
- Upgrade your plan
- Reduce request frequency

### 5. Wrong model

Opus is slower than Sonnet, which is slower than Haiku.

**Symptoms:**
- Consistently slow on all tasks
- Using Opus for simple questions

**Fix:**
```
/model sonnet
```

Or for simple tasks:
```
/model haiku
```

## Diagnosis Steps

### Step 1: Check context size

Look at the token counter:
```
[tokens: 150k/200k]  ← High usage
```

If above 100k, run `/compact`.

### Step 2: Check session duration

How long have you been in this session?

- Under 30 min: Probably not context bloat
- Over 1 hour: Likely context bloat

### Step 3: Test with fresh session

```bash
# Exit current session
Ctrl+C

# Start fresh
claude
```

If fresh session is fast, the old session was bloated.

### Step 4: Test API directly

```bash
time claude --headless "Say hello"
```

If this is slow, it's network or rate limiting.

### Step 5: Check model

```
What model are you using?
```

If Opus, switch to Sonnet for faster responses.

## Quick Fixes

### Immediate relief

```
/compact
```

Reduces context by summarizing history.

### Change model

```
/model haiku
```

Fastest responses for simple tasks.

### Start fresh

```bash
claude --session "new-task"
```

Clean context, fast responses.

## Prevention

### 1. Compact regularly

Every 30-45 minutes in long sessions:
```
/compact
```

### 2. Use appropriate model

| Task | Model |
|------|-------|
| Quick questions | Haiku |
| Most coding | Sonnet |
| Complex architecture | Opus |

### 3. Read files selectively

```
# Good
Read the handleLogin function in auth.ts

# Avoid
Read the entire 2000-line auth.ts
```

### 4. Start fresh for new tasks

Don't continue old sessions for unrelated work.

### 5. Monitor token usage

Watch the status bar. Compact before hitting 70%.

## Measuring Response Time

### In-session timing

Claude shows response time after each message.

### Headless benchmarking

```bash
# Time a simple task
time claude --headless "What is 2+2?"

# Expected: Under 5 seconds
```

### Compare models

```bash
time claude --headless --model haiku "Simple task"
time claude --headless --model sonnet "Simple task"
time claude --headless --model opus "Simple task"
```

## When Slowness Is Expected

Some operations are legitimately slow:

| Operation | Expected Time |
|-----------|--------------|
| Simple question | 2-5 seconds |
| Code generation | 5-15 seconds |
| Multi-file refactor | 15-30 seconds |
| Complex analysis | 30-60 seconds |

If you're within these ranges, it's normal.

## Escalation

If nothing helps:

1. Check [Anthropic status page](https://status.anthropic.com)
2. Try again later
3. Contact support with:
   - Session ID
   - Approximate time
   - What you were doing

## Quick Reference

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Slow over time | Context bloat | `/compact` |
| Slow from start | Network/model | Check connection, use Haiku |
| Intermittently slow | Rate limiting | Wait, upgrade plan |
| Slow after file read | Large files | Read selectively |
| Always slow | Wrong model | `/model sonnet` |
