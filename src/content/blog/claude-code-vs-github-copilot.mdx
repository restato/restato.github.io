GitHub Copilot and Claude Code both help you write code, but they solve fundamentally different problems.

## The Core Difference

**GitHub Copilot** is an autocomplete tool. It predicts what you're about to type and suggests completions.

**Claude Code** is an agent. It understands tasks, reads your codebase, and executes multi-step operations.

Think of it this way:
- Copilot finishes your sentences
- Claude Code writes the entire document

## When to Use GitHub Copilot

### Writing boilerplate code

Copilot excels at:
```python
# Type a function signature, get the body
def calculate_total(items: List[Item]) -> float:
    # Copilot suggests the implementation
```

### Quick completions

Typing repetitive patterns:
- Test cases with similar structure
- CRUD operations
- Interface implementations

### You want minimal context switching

Copilot works as you type. No need to:
- Open a chat window
- Explain what you want
- Wait for a response

### Learning new libraries

When you're not sure of the API:
```javascript
// Start typing, Copilot suggests based on library patterns
const response = await axios.
// Copilot: get('https://api.example.com/users')
```

## When to Use Claude Code

### Complex, multi-step tasks

```
Refactor the authentication system to use JWT, update all affected
routes, add tests, and update the documentation
```

Claude Code handles the entire workflow.

### Understanding unfamiliar code

```
Explain how the payment processing flow works in this codebase
```

Claude reads multiple files and gives you a coherent explanation.

### Codebase-wide changes

```
Update all deprecated API calls to use the new v2 endpoints
```

Copilot can't do this. Claude Code can.

### When you need reasoning

Claude Code can:
- Analyze architecture decisions
- Find potential bugs
- Suggest improvements with justification

Copilot just predicts the next token.

### Automation and CI/CD

```bash
# In GitHub Actions
claude --headless "review this PR and post comments"
```

Copilot doesn't run as a CLI tool.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | GitHub Copilot | Claude Code |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Type | Autocomplete | Agent |
| Interaction | As you type | Conversational |
| Multi-file | Limited | Yes |
| Codebase understanding | No | Yes |
| Git integration | No | Yes |
| CLI usage | No | Yes |
| Automation | No | Yes |
| IDE support | Most IDEs | Terminal + IDE plugins |
| Works offline | No | No |

## Pricing Comparison

**GitHub Copilot:**
- Individual: $10/month or $100/year
- Business: $19/user/month
- Enterprise: $39/user/month

**Claude Code:**
- API usage-based (no subscription)
- Roughly $3-20/month for typical usage
- Can spike with heavy use

Copilot's pricing is predictable. Claude Code varies with usage.

## Quality of Output

**Copilot strengths:**
- Fast, inline suggestions
- Good at common patterns
- Less likely to hallucinate APIs

**Claude Code strengths:**
- Better reasoning
- More coherent multi-file changes
- Can explain its decisions

For single-line completions, Copilot is faster. For complex tasks, Claude Code produces better results.

## Using Both Together

Many developers use both:

**Copilot for:**
- Day-to-day typing assistance
- Quick completions
- Boilerplate generation

**Claude Code for:**
- Complex refactoring
- Bug investigation
- Architecture changes
- Code review
- Documentation

They complement each other well. Copilot helps you write faster. Claude Code helps you think through complex problems.

## Example: Same Task, Different Approaches

**Task:** Add input validation to a form

**With Copilot:**
1. Start typing the validation function
2. Accept suggestions
3. Repeat for each field
4. Manually ensure consistency

**With Claude Code:**
```
Add comprehensive validation to the signup form:
- Email format validation
- Password strength requirements
- Match our existing validation patterns in other forms
- Add appropriate error messages
```

Claude Code reads existing patterns and generates consistent code across all fields.

## The Keyboard Shortcut Test

If you want quick completions while typing: Copilot
If you want to describe a task and have it done: Claude Code

## My Recommendation

**Use Copilot if:**
- You want typing acceleration
- You're writing straightforward code
- You prefer minimal interruption

**Use Claude Code if:**
- You're doing complex multi-file work
- You need codebase understanding
- You want automation

**Use both if:**
- You can justify the combined cost
- You want speed AND intelligence
- You work on varied tasks

## Switching From Copilot to Claude Code

If you're a Copilot user trying Claude Code:

1. Expect a different workflow (conversational, not inline)
2. Be more explicit about what you want
3. Take advantage of multi-file capabilities
4. Use CLAUDE.md to provide project context

The mental model shift: stop trying to use Claude Code like autocomplete. Instead, treat it as a capable junior developer you're delegating tasks to.
