Claude Code can run multiple tasks in parallel using subagents and multiple sessions. This dramatically speeds up complex work.

## Why Parallel Matters

Sequential workflow:
```
Research auth patterns    → 15 min
Research database options → 15 min
Research caching          → 15 min
Total: 45 minutes
```

Parallel workflow:
```
Research auth patterns    ┐
Research database options ├→ 15 min total
Research caching          ┘
```

Same work, 3x faster.

## Method 1: Subagents

Subagents are separate Claude instances that run within your session.

### Launching parallel exploration

```
Launch 3 explore agents in parallel:
1. Find all authentication-related files
2. Find all database query patterns
3. Find all API endpoint definitions
```

Claude spawns three agents that work simultaneously.

### Viewing results

Results come back as each agent completes. Claude synthesizes them.

### When to use subagents

- Exploring large codebases
- Searching for patterns across files
- Independent research tasks
- Gathering information before implementation

## Method 2: Multiple Terminal Sessions

Run separate Claude Code instances:

### Terminal 1
```bash
cd ~/project
claude --session "feature-auth"
```

### Terminal 2
```bash
cd ~/project
claude --session "feature-payment"
```

### Terminal 3
```bash
cd ~/project
claude --session "bug-fixes"
```

Each session works independently.

## Method 3: Git Worktrees + Sessions

For parallel feature development without conflicts:

### Setup worktrees

```bash
# Main checkout
cd ~/project

# Create worktrees for parallel work
git worktree add ../project-auth feature/auth
git worktree add ../project-payment feature/payment
git worktree add ../project-tests test-improvements
```

### Run sessions in each

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd ../project-auth
claude --session "auth-feature"

# Terminal 2
cd ../project-payment
claude --session "payment-feature"

# Terminal 3
cd ../project-tests
claude --session "test-work"
```

No merge conflicts during development. Each worktree is isolated.

## Subagent Patterns

### Pattern 1: Parallel research

```
I need to understand the codebase before refactoring.

Launch agents to explore:
1. How authentication works
2. How API routes are structured
3. How database queries are organized

Summarize findings when done.
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel validation

```
Before deploying, validate in parallel:
1. Run unit tests
2. Run integration tests
3. Check for security issues
4. Verify build succeeds

Report any failures.
```

### Pattern 3: Parallel code review

```
Review these 5 PRs simultaneously:
1. PR #123 - Auth changes
2. PR #124 - UI updates
3. PR #125 - API additions
4. PR #126 - Database migrations
5. PR #127 - Config changes

Summarize issues found in each.
```

## Background Agents

Run agents without waiting:

```
Run this in the background: Analyze test coverage for the entire project

Continue with current work...

[Later]
Check on the background analysis
```

### Headless background tasks

```bash
# Start a background task
claude --headless "Analyze and document all API endpoints" &

# Continue with other work
claude
```

## Managing Parallel Work

### Avoid conflicts

When running multiple sessions:

1. Work on different files
2. Use worktrees for isolation
3. Coordinate through git branches
4. Merge frequently

### Share context efficiently

Create a shared CLAUDE.md that all sessions read:

```markdown
# Project Context

## Current Sprint
- Auth refactor (Alice - Terminal 1)
- Payment feature (Bob - Terminal 2)
- Test coverage (CI - Background)

## Shared Conventions
...
```

### Monitor resource usage

Multiple sessions = more API calls = higher costs. Watch your token usage.

## Real-World Parallel Workflow

### Scenario: Major feature implementation

```bash
# Morning: Research phase (parallel)
# Terminal 1
claude --session "research-auth"
# "Explore how similar apps implement OAuth"

# Terminal 2
claude --session "research-db"
# "Analyze our database schema for user tables"

# Afternoon: Implementation phase (parallel worktrees)
git worktree add ../impl-auth feature/oauth
git worktree add ../impl-db feature/user-schema

# Terminal 1 (auth worktree)
cd ../impl-auth
claude --session "impl-auth"

# Terminal 2 (db worktree)
cd ../impl-db
claude --session "impl-db"

# Evening: Integration (single session)
git worktree remove ../impl-auth
git worktree remove ../impl-db
git merge feature/oauth feature/user-schema
claude --session "integration"
# "Resolve any conflicts and ensure everything works together"
```

## Limitations

### Subagents

- Share the same context window
- Can't modify files (exploration only)
- Limited to ~3 concurrent agents

### Multiple sessions

- Don't share context
- Can have file conflicts
- Higher total token usage

### Worktrees

- Require disk space
- Need manual conflict resolution
- Git complexity increases

## Quick Reference

| Method | Best For | Limitation |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Subagents | Research, exploration | Read-only |
| Multiple sessions | Independent features | No shared context |
| Worktrees + sessions | Parallel development | Git complexity |
| Background agents | Long-running tasks | Async results |

## Parallel Checklist

Before going parallel, verify:

- [ ] Tasks are truly independent
- [ ] File conflicts won't occur
- [ ] You have enough API quota
- [ ] You can track all parallel work
- [ ] Merge strategy is planned

Parallel execution is powerful but adds complexity. Use it when the time savings justify the coordination overhead.
