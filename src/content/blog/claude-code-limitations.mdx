Claude Code is powerful, but it has limits. Knowing them upfront saves frustration.

## Technical Limitations

### No persistent memory

Claude doesn't remember previous sessions:

```
Session 1: "We decided to use Redis for caching"
[End session]

Session 2: "What caching solution did we pick?"
Claude: "I don't have information about previous sessions"
```

**Workaround:** Document decisions in CLAUDE.md or project docs.

### Context window limit

There's a maximum amount of text Claude can consider at once:

```
Very long session + many files = context overflow
```

**Workaround:** Use `/compact`, start fresh sessions, read files selectively.

### No real-time updates

Claude can't watch for file changes or run continuously:

```
# Not possible
"Watch for changes and fix any new errors"
```

**Workaround:** Use hooks or CI/CD for continuous monitoring.

### No GUI interaction

Claude can't click buttons or see screens:

```
# Not possible
"Click the submit button in the browser"
```

**Workaround:** Use browser automation tools (Playwright, Puppeteer).

### No audio/video processing

Claude can't listen or watch:

```
# Not possible
"Transcribe this meeting recording"
```

**Workaround:** Use dedicated transcription services.

## Accuracy Limitations

### Hallucinations

Claude can confidently state incorrect things:

```
Claude: "The foo.bar() method does X"
Reality: foo.bar() does Y, or doesn't exist
```

**Mitigation:** Verify important claims. Run the code. Check documentation.

### Outdated knowledge

Claude's training has a cutoff date:

```
"What's the latest version of React?"
# May not know the very latest release
```

**Mitigation:** Ask Claude to check package.json or search online.

### Library-specific details

Claude may not know every API perfectly:

```
"Use the new XYZ library"
# Might mix up old and new API patterns
```

**Mitigation:** Reference official docs, test the code.

## Scope Limitations

### Can't access external services

Without MCP, Claude can't:

- Query databases
- Call APIs
- Access cloud services

**Workaround:** Set up MCP servers for needed integrations.

### Can't access private packages

Claude can't authenticate to private npm registries:

```
# Claude can't see
@company/private-package
```

**Workaround:** Share relevant code directly or document the interfaces.

### Limited network access

Claude can read public URLs but can't:

- Access localhost services
- Authenticate to sites
- Access intranet resources

## Behavioral Limitations

### No autonomous operation

Claude needs prompts to act:

```
# Not possible
"Work on this for 8 hours while I'm away"
```

**Workaround:** Use headless mode in scripts/CI for automated tasks.

### Can't learn preferences over time

Each session starts fresh:

```
"I've told you 100 times to use semicolons"
# Next session: Doesn't remember
```

**Workaround:** Put preferences in CLAUDE.md.

### Won't make decisions without input

Claude asks before major changes:

```
Claude: "Should I use approach A or B?"
# Won't proceed without answer
```

This is a safety feature, but can slow things down.

## Safety Limitations

### Won't bypass security

Claude refuses to:

- Disable security features
- Exploit vulnerabilities (without auth context)
- Access protected data inappropriately

### Won't generate harmful code

Requests for malware, exploits, or harmful content are refused.

### Respects rate limits

Claude won't try to bypass API rate limits or quotas.

## Environment Limitations

### Platform-specific issues

Some commands differ by OS:

```
# Works on macOS/Linux
sed -i '' 's/foo/bar/g' file

# Different on Linux
sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' file
```

Claude tries to detect your platform but may get it wrong.

### Shell-specific features

Complex bash features may not work in all environments:

```
# May fail in some shells
array=("a" "b" "c")
```

### IDE integration limits

Claude Code works best in terminal. IDE extensions have fewer features.

## What Claude IS Good At

Despite limitations, Claude excels at:

| Strength | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Code generation | "Write a function that..." |
| Code explanation | "How does this work?" |
| Refactoring | "Convert to async/await" |
| Bug finding | "Why might this fail?" |
| Multi-file changes | "Update all API calls" |
| Documentation | "Document this module" |
| Test writing | "Write tests for this" |

## Setting Realistic Expectations

### Claude is a tool, not a replacement

Use Claude for:
- Accelerating routine work
- Exploring unfamiliar code
- Generating boilerplate
- Reviewing and improving code

Not for:
- Making all decisions
- Running autonomously forever
- Replacing domain expertise

### Verify important output

```
# Good practice
Claude writes code → You review → Tests verify → Ship
```

### Start with smaller tasks

Build trust through small wins before attempting large autonomous tasks.

## Summary

| Category | Can't Do | Workaround |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Memory | Remember past sessions | CLAUDE.md |
| Context | Handle infinite context | /compact, fresh sessions |
| Watching | Monitor continuously | Hooks, CI/CD |
| GUI | Click buttons | Browser automation |
| Accuracy | Be 100% correct | Verify, test |
| External | Access services | MCP servers |
| Autonomy | Work forever alone | Headless in scripts |
