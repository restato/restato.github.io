You've been working in Claude Code for a while, and suddenly you see:

```
Error: Context window limit exceeded
```

Or Claude's responses start getting cut off, it forgets what you just discussed, or it references files that no longer exist.

## Why This Happens

Claude has a finite context window (the amount of text it can "remember" in a single session). As your conversation grows:

1. Older messages get summarized or dropped
2. The model struggles to maintain coherence
3. Eventually, you hit the hard limit

This is more likely when:
- Sessions run for hours
- You're reading many large files
- You're working on a complex multi-file refactor

## Solution 1: Start a Fresh Session

The simplest fix. Close your current session and start new:

```bash
# Exit current session
Ctrl+C

# Start fresh
claude
```

Fresh sessions read the actual current state of your files, not stale cached versions.

## Solution 2: Use /compact

If you want to continue but need to free up space:

```
/compact
```

This summarizes your conversation history, preserving key context while reducing token usage. Use it:
- Before starting a complex new task
- When responses start slowing down
- Every hour or so in long sessions

## Solution 3: Be Selective About File Reading

Don't let Claude read entire large files when you only need a section:

```
# Instead of this
Read the entire utils.ts file

# Do this
Read lines 50-100 of utils.ts
```

Or ask Claude to read only specific functions:

```
Read the handleSubmit function in Form.tsx
```

## Solution 4: Split Large Tasks

Instead of one massive session for a feature:

```
Session 1: Design the database schema
Session 2: Implement the API endpoints
Session 3: Build the frontend components
Session 4: Write tests
```

Each session starts clean with only the relevant context.

## Prevention Strategies

### Monitor Your Usage

Claude Code shows context usage in the status line. Watch for it approaching limits.

### Name Sessions Descriptively

```
claude --session "auth-refactor-jan17"
```

This helps you track what each session was for and resume if needed.

### Use Subagents for Exploration

When exploring a codebase, use subagents instead of reading everything yourself:

```
Use an explore agent to find all authentication-related files
```

Subagents have their own context, so their exploration doesn't bloat your main session.

### Clear Context Strategically

After completing a subtask, you can tell Claude:

```
We're done with the database migration. You can forget the migration file details.
Now let's work on the API endpoints.
```

This hints that older context is less relevant.

## Signs Your Context Is Getting Stale

- Claude suggests code for functions you already deleted
- It uses old variable names you've since renamed
- Responses reference outdated project structure
- The same questions get asked repeatedly

When you notice these, it's time for `/compact` or a fresh session.

## Advanced: Token Budgeting

If you're doing a complex task that needs a long session:

1. Start with `/compact` to baseline
2. Read only essential files
3. Use targeted searches instead of broad exploration
4. Periodically check context usage
5. `/compact` again when approaching 70% usage

## Quick Reference

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Hard error (limit exceeded) | Start fresh session |
| Slow responses | `/compact` |
| Stale suggestions | Start fresh session |
| Forgotten context | `/compact` or re-read key files |
| Cut-off responses | `/compact` then retry |
