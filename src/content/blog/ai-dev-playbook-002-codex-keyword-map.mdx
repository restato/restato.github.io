Codex Keyword Map and Planning System for Developers is part of the 100-post engineering series focused on practical AI development workflows. The primary keyword for this entry is **codex**, supported by adjacent concepts such as reliability, evaluation, and team-scale delivery.

## Why This Topic Matters
Developer teams are moving from single-assistant usage to orchestrated agent systems. That shift introduces new complexity in architecture, testing, and governance. A documented playbook helps teams scale without losing code quality.

## Practical Implementation Pattern
1. Define one measurable objective (speed, quality, cost, or reliability).
2. Build a small workflow with explicit agent roles and tool boundaries.
3. Add evaluations that run on each iteration, not just before release.
4. Capture outcomes in a reusable skill or runbook for the team.

## Common Pitfalls
- Running multiple agents without ownership boundaries.
- Optimizing for output volume instead of merge-ready quality.
- Shipping model changes without rollback and observability plans.

## What to Measure
- Lead time from issue to merged PR.
- Defect rate in AI-generated code paths.
- Cost per successful change set.
- Reuse rate of skills, prompts, and evaluation suites.
