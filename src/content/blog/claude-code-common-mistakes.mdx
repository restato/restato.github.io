After watching many developers use Claude Code, these are the most common mistakes and how to avoid them.

## Mistake 1: Vague Prompts

### The mistake

```
Fix it
Make it better
Clean this up
```

### Why it fails

Claude doesn't know:
- What "it" is
- What "better" means to you
- What "clean" looks like

### The fix

```
Fix the null pointer error on line 45 of auth.ts
by adding a check before accessing user.email

Refactor handleSubmit to use async/await instead
of .then() chains

Remove unused imports and sort remaining imports
alphabetically in utils.ts
```

## Mistake 2: Not Providing Context

### The mistake

```
Update the API
```

### Why it fails

Which API? Update how? What's the current state?

### The fix

```
Update the /api/users endpoint to:
1. Accept an optional 'status' query parameter
2. Filter results when status is provided
3. Return all users when status is omitted

Currently the endpoint is in src/api/users.ts
```

## Mistake 3: One Giant Prompt

### The mistake

```
Build a complete e-commerce site with user auth,
product catalog, shopping cart, checkout with
Stripe, order history, admin dashboard,
inventory management, email notifications,
and analytics.
```

### Why it fails

Too much for one conversation. Claude will:
- Miss details
- Create inconsistencies
- Overwhelm the context window

### The fix

Break it down:

```
Session 1: Set up user authentication
Session 2: Build product catalog
Session 3: Implement shopping cart
...
```

## Mistake 4: Ignoring CLAUDE.md

### The mistake

Not creating a CLAUDE.md, then being frustrated when Claude:
- Uses wrong frameworks
- Ignores coding conventions
- Doesn't know project structure

### The fix

Create CLAUDE.md with:
- Tech stack
- Commands
- Code style
- Key files

Claude reads this automatically and follows it.

## Mistake 5: Never Starting Fresh

### The mistake

Using the same session for hours:
- Context bloats
- Old info persists
- Responses slow down
- Quality degrades

### The fix

Start new sessions for new tasks. Use `/compact` during long sessions.

## Mistake 6: Blindly Accepting Output

### The mistake

```
Claude generates code → Immediately commit → Production breaks
```

### Why it fails

Claude can:
- Hallucinate APIs
- Miss edge cases
- Introduce subtle bugs

### The fix

```
Claude generates code → Review → Test → Then commit
```

## Mistake 7: Fighting the Tool

### The mistake

Getting angry when Claude misunderstands:
```
I TOLD YOU THREE TIMES to use semicolons!!!
```

### The fix

1. Check your CLAUDE.md for style rules
2. Provide clear examples
3. Start fresh if stuck
4. Report actual bugs to Anthropic

Claude isn't being stubborn. It literally doesn't remember.

## Mistake 8: Using Wrong Model for Task

### The mistake

Using Opus for every simple question:
```
/model opus
What's the port number in config?
```

Costs 60x more for no benefit.

### The fix

Match model to task:
- Haiku: Simple questions, searches
- Sonnet: Most coding tasks
- Opus: Complex reasoning only

## Mistake 9: Not Using Available Features

### The mistake

Manually doing what Claude automates:
- Formatting code by hand (use hooks)
- Creating boilerplate (use skills)
- Running tests manually (use hooks)

### The fix

Set up:
- Hooks for auto-formatting and tests
- Skills for repetitive workflows
- Custom commands for common tasks

## Mistake 10: Expecting Perfect Code

### The mistake

```
Write the authentication system. It should be perfect.
```

### Why it fails

First drafts are never perfect. Even human experts iterate.

### The fix

Plan for iteration:
```
1. Generate initial implementation
2. Review and identify issues
3. Refine with specific feedback
4. Test and fix edge cases
5. Polish and finalize
```

## Mistake 11: Skipping the Plan

### The mistake

Diving into complex changes without planning:
```
Refactor the entire codebase to microservices
```

### The fix

Use plan mode:
```
/plan
Let's think through the microservices refactoring...
```

Get alignment before making changes.

## Mistake 12: Ignoring Error Messages

### The mistake

```
Claude: Error: Cannot find module 'xyz'
You: Just fix it
Claude: Error: Cannot find module 'xyz'
You: FIX IT
```

### The fix

Read the error. Provide context:
```
Getting "Cannot find module 'xyz'".
I installed it with npm install xyz.
The import is: import { thing } from 'xyz'
What's wrong?
```

## Quick Reference

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Vague prompts | Be specific with files, lines, expectations |
| No context | Describe current state and desired state |
| Giant prompts | Break into multiple sessions |
| No CLAUDE.md | Create one with tech stack and conventions |
| Never fresh | Start new sessions for new tasks |
| Blind trust | Review and test before committing |
| Fighting | Clear prompts, fresh sessions |
| Wrong model | Match model to task complexity |
| Missing features | Use hooks, skills, commands |
| Expecting perfect | Plan for iteration |

## The Meta-Mistake

The biggest mistake: treating Claude as either:
- A magic solution that should work perfectly
- A dumb tool that can't do anything

Reality: Claude is a capable assistant that needs clear direction and reasonable expectations. Work with it, not against it.
