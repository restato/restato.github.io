Claude Code has deep git integration. It can create commits, manage branches, and even open pull requests.

## Automatic Checkpoints

Claude creates git checkpoints automatically before making changes:

```
Before: Working on auth feature
Claude: [makes changes]
After: Checkpoint created, changes saved
```

You can always roll back if something goes wrong.

## Viewing Changes

### See what changed

```
Show me what files were modified
```

Or:

```
Run git status
```

### View diffs

```
Show the diff for auth.ts
```

Or:

```
What changes did you make?
```

## Creating Commits

### Ask Claude to commit

```
Commit these changes with an appropriate message
```

Claude will:
1. Run `git status`
2. Stage relevant files
3. Write a descriptive commit message
4. Create the commit

### Conventional commits

```
Commit using conventional commit format
```

Results in:
```
feat(auth): add password reset functionality

- Add reset password endpoint
- Send reset email
- Validate reset tokens
```

### Specific commit message

```
Commit with message "fix: resolve login timeout issue"
```

## Branch Management

### Create a branch

```
Create a branch for the new search feature
```

### Switch branches

```
Switch to the main branch
```

### List branches

```
What branches exist?
```

## Pull Requests

### Create a PR

```
Create a pull request for this branch
```

Claude will:
1. Push the branch
2. Generate a PR description
3. Create the PR via GitHub CLI

### PR with specifics

```
Create a PR targeting the develop branch with a detailed description
```

## Code Review

### Review staged changes

```
Review my staged changes before I commit
```

### Review a PR

```
Review PR #123
```

### Get feedback

```
What could be improved in the changes I just made?
```

## Common Workflows

### Feature development

```
1. Create branch: "Create a branch for user-profile-feature"
2. Make changes: "Add the profile page component"
3. Review: "Review these changes"
4. Commit: "Commit with a descriptive message"
5. PR: "Create a pull request"
```

### Bug fix

```
1. Find issue: "Find where the login bug occurs"
2. Fix: "Fix the null pointer error"
3. Test: "Run the auth tests"
4. Commit: "Commit as a bug fix"
5. PR: "Create a PR for review"
```

### Quick cleanup

```
1. Fix: "Remove unused imports from all files"
2. Commit: "Commit as a chore"
```

## Gitignore and Sensitive Files

Claude respects gitignore and won't commit sensitive files:

```
Claude will NOT commit:
- .env files
- API keys
- Credentials
- Files matching .gitignore
```

If you try:
```
Commit the .env file
```

Claude will warn you about committing secrets.

## Conflict Resolution

### Identify conflicts

```
Are there any merge conflicts?
```

### Resolve conflicts

```
Resolve the merge conflict in utils.ts, keeping our changes
```

### After resolution

```
Mark conflicts as resolved and commit
```

## Git History

### Recent commits

```
Show the last 5 commits
```

### Specific file history

```
Show the commit history for auth.ts
```

### Who changed what

```
Who last modified the login function?
```

## Undoing Changes

### Discard changes

```
Discard changes to auth.ts
```

### Revert a commit

```
Revert the last commit
```

### Reset to checkpoint

```
Reset to the last Claude checkpoint
```

## Stashing

### Stash current work

```
Stash my current changes
```

### Apply stash

```
Apply the last stash
```

### List stashes

```
What's in my stash?
```

## Branch Protection

Claude respects branch protection:

```
# Claude will refuse to:
- Push directly to main/master
- Force push without permission
- Delete protected branches
```

For protected branches:
```
Create a PR to merge this into main
```

## Custom Git Hooks

Integrate Claude with git hooks:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Run Claude to check for issues
claude --headless "Check staged files for obvious problems"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Review before committing

```
Review the changes, then commit if they look good
```

### 2. Use descriptive messages

```
Commit with a message explaining why, not just what
```

### 3. Keep commits focused

```
Commit the auth changes separately from the UI changes
```

### 4. Don't force push

```
# Claude won't do this without explicit request
git push --force  # Avoided by default
```
