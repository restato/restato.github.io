Super annoying issue today. Every time I typed in tmux, the scroll position kept jumping up randomly.

## The problem

Typing anything would cause the terminal to flicker and scroll position to jump. Made it impossible to work comfortably.

## Finding the cause

Dug through my `.tmux.conf` and found the culprit:

```bash
set -g status-interval 1
```

Status bar was refreshing every single second. Combined with Catppuccin theme showing `cpu`, `weather`, `battery`, and `directory` - that's a lot of refreshing.

```bash
set -g @catppuccin_status_modules_right "directory cpu weather battery date_time"
```

Each refresh was causing the terminal to redraw, which messed with scroll position.

## The fix

1. Bumped status interval to 60 seconds (only showing time anyway):

```bash
set -g status-interval 60
```

2. Removed cpu/weather/battery from status bar:

```bash
set -g @catppuccin_status_modules_right "directory date_time"
```

3. Removed unused plugins:

```bash
# Removed these lines
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-cpu'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-battery'
set -g @plugin 'Morantron/tmux-fingers'
```

4. Turned off monitor-activity:

```bash
setw -g monitor-activity off
```

## Gotchas

`tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf` wasn't enough. Had to kill the entire tmux server:

```bash
tmux kill-server && tmux
```

Plugins stay loaded in memory even after config reload. Full restart was needed to actually remove them.
