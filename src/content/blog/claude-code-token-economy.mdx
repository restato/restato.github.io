Claude Code charges based on token usage. Understanding how tokens work helps you predict costs and use Claude Code efficiently.

## What Are Tokens?

Tokens are pieces of text. Roughly:
- 1 token = 4 characters in English
- 100 tokens = about 75 words
- 1,000 tokens = about 750 words

Code is less predictable:
- Short variable names = fewer tokens
- Long class names = more tokens
- Comments add tokens too

## How Costs Are Calculated

You pay for:
1. **Input tokens** - What you send (prompts, file contents)
2. **Output tokens** - What Claude generates (responses, code)

Pricing varies by model (approximate as of 2025):

| Model | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Haiku | $0.25/1M tokens | $1.25/1M tokens |
| Sonnet | $3/1M tokens | $15/1M tokens |
| Opus | $15/1M tokens | $75/1M tokens |

## What Consumes Tokens

### System prompt

Every request includes a system prompt (~2,000-5,000 tokens). This is sent with every interaction.

### Conversation history

As your session grows, more history is sent:
- Start of session: ~5k tokens
- After 30 minutes: ~50k tokens
- After 2 hours: ~150k+ tokens

### File reading

Reading files adds tokens:
- Small file (100 lines): ~500 tokens
- Medium file (500 lines): ~2,500 tokens
- Large file (2000 lines): ~10,000 tokens

### Tool calls

Each tool call (read, write, bash) adds overhead:
- Tool definition: ~100 tokens
- Tool input: varies
- Tool output: varies

## Estimating Session Costs

### Quick estimate

A typical development session:
- Light (30 min, simple tasks): $0.10-0.50
- Medium (1-2 hours, moderate tasks): $0.50-2.00
- Heavy (3+ hours, complex tasks): $2.00-10.00

### Detailed calculation

Example session:
```
System prompt:           3,000 tokens
Reading 5 files:        15,000 tokens
Conversation (1 hour):  30,000 tokens
Code generation:        10,000 tokens
───────────────────────────────────────
Total input:           ~58,000 tokens
Total output:          ~10,000 tokens

Cost (Sonnet):
  Input:  58k × $3/1M = $0.17
  Output: 10k × $15/1M = $0.15
  Total: ~$0.32
```

## Monitoring Usage

### In-session monitoring

Claude Code shows token usage in the status bar:

```
[tokens: 45k/200k]
```

Watch this as you work.

### API dashboard

Check [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) for:
- Daily usage
- Cost breakdown
- Usage trends

### Set up alerts

Configure alerts before hitting budget limits.

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Start fresh sessions frequently

Long sessions accumulate history. Fresh sessions reset:

```bash
# Instead of continuing a 2-hour session
# Start fresh for new tasks
claude
```

### 2. Use /compact

Reduce context without losing essential info:

```
/compact
```

### 3. Choose the right model

| Task | Model | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| Quick questions | Haiku | 12x cheaper than Sonnet |
| Code generation | Sonnet | Good balance |
| Complex architecture | Opus | Better reasoning |

Switch with:
```
/model haiku
```

### 4. Be specific in prompts

Vague prompts lead to more back-and-forth:

```
# Expensive: Multiple rounds needed
Fix the bug

# Cheaper: One-shot completion
Fix the null pointer error on line 45 of auth.ts
by adding a null check before accessing user.email
```

### 5. Read files selectively

```
# Expensive: Full file read
Read utils.ts

# Cheaper: Targeted read
Read the validateEmail function in utils.ts
```

### 6. Batch related work

```
# Expensive: 5 separate sessions
Session 1: Fix typo in file1
Session 2: Fix typo in file2
...

# Cheaper: 1 session
Fix all typos in the auth module
```

## Daily/Monthly Budgeting

### Solo developer estimates

| Usage Level | Daily | Monthly |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| Light | $0.50 | $15 |
| Moderate | $2 | $60 |
| Heavy | $5 | $150 |

### Team estimates

Multiply by team size, but expect overlap savings from shared context in CLAUDE.md.

## Hidden Token Costs

### Repeated context

Every message resends conversation history. A 50-message conversation resends earlier messages 50 times.

### Tool overhead

Each tool call adds fixed overhead. Many small reads cost more than one large read.

### Failed attempts

When Claude tries something that fails, you still pay for the attempt.

## Tracking ROI

Consider time saved:

```
Developer hourly rate: $75
Time saved per day with Claude: 2 hours
Value created: $150/day

Claude Code cost: $5/day
ROI: 30x
```

Even heavy usage often pays for itself quickly.

## Quick Reference

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| 1 token = | ~4 characters |
| Reading 500 line file = | ~2,500 tokens |
| 1 hour session = | $0.50-2.00 (Sonnet) |
| Cheapest model | Haiku (12x cheaper) |
| Most capable | Opus (5x more expensive) |
| Reduce costs | /compact, fresh sessions, specific prompts |
