You're in the middle of a productive session when Claude Code stops responding:

```
Error 429: Rate limit exceeded. Please retry after X seconds.
```

## Why This Happens

Anthropic enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage across all users. You hit the limit when:

1. Making too many requests in a short time
2. Sending too many tokens per minute
3. Your plan's quota is exhausted

Rate limits vary by plan:
- Free tier: Very limited
- Pro: Higher limits
- Max/Team: Highest limits

## Immediate Fix: Wait and Retry

The error message usually tells you how long to wait:

```
Please retry after 60 seconds
```

Just wait, then continue. Claude Code often retries automatically.

## Solution 1: Slow Down Your Workflow

If you're hitting limits frequently, you're probably:

**Spamming small requests:**
```
# Instead of many small asks
Fix this typo
Now fix that typo
And this one

# Batch them
Fix all typos in this file
```

**Requesting too many file reads:**
```
# Instead of reading files one by one
Read file1.ts
Read file2.ts
Read file3.ts

# Let Claude read multiple at once
Read the auth module files
```

## Solution 2: Use Efficient Prompts

Vague prompts cause more back-and-forth (more requests):

```
# Inefficient - leads to follow-up questions
Improve this code

# Efficient - one-shot completion
Refactor this function to use async/await, add error handling,
and follow our project's naming convention from CLAUDE.md
```

## Solution 3: Switch to a Higher Plan

If rate limits are blocking your productivity:

| Plan | Limits | Best For |
|------|--------|----------|
| Free | ~10 requests/min | Testing |
| Pro ($20/mo) | Higher | Individual developers |
| Max | Much higher | Heavy users |
| Team | Custom | Organizations |

Check your current usage at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com).

## Solution 4: Batch Operations

Instead of running Claude multiple times:

```bash
# Inefficient - 5 separate Claude sessions
claude "fix bug in file1"
claude "fix bug in file2"
claude "fix bug in file3"
claude "fix bug in file4"
claude "fix bug in file5"

# Efficient - 1 session
claude "fix the same bug pattern across all files in src/utils/"
```

## Solution 5: Use Subagents Wisely

Subagents consume quota too. Don't spawn multiple agents for simple tasks:

```
# Overkill for simple search
Launch 3 agents to find the login function

# Appropriate
Search for the login function in src/auth/
```

Reserve parallel agents for genuinely complex exploration tasks.

## Prevention: Monitor Your Usage

### Check your API usage dashboard

Visit [console.anthropic.com/usage](https://console.anthropic.com) to see:
- Requests per day
- Tokens consumed
- Approaching limits

### Set up alerts

Configure notifications before you hit 80% of your quota.

### Track session token usage

Claude Code shows token consumption. Watch for expensive operations:
- Reading large files
- Long conversations
- Frequent tool calls

## Handling Limits in CI/CD

If using Claude Code in GitHub Actions or GitLab CI:

```yaml
# Add retry logic
- name: Run Claude Code
  run: |
    for i in {1..3}; do
      claude --headless "review this PR" && break
      sleep 60
    done
```

And consider:
- Running on a schedule, not every push
- Using a dedicated API key with higher limits
- Caching results to avoid duplicate work

## Cost vs Speed Tradeoff

Higher limits cost more. To stay efficient:

1. Use `/compact` to reduce token usage
2. Choose appropriate model (Haiku for simple, Opus for complex)
3. Write clear, complete prompts
4. Batch related work into single sessions

## Quick Troubleshooting

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Occasional 429 | Wait and retry |
| Frequent 429s | Batch your requests |
| Daily limit hit | Upgrade plan |
| CI/CD failures | Add retry logic + schedule |
| Token limit (not rate) | Use `/compact`, start fresh session |

## Check If It's Actually Rate Limiting

Sometimes 429 errors are confused with other issues:

```bash
# Test if API is accessible
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","max_tokens":10,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'
```

If this works, the issue is with your usage pattern. If it fails with 429, you've genuinely hit the limit.
