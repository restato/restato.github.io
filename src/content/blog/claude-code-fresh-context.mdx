Long Claude Code sessions accumulate stale context that degrades output quality. Knowing when to start fresh makes a significant difference.

## The Problem with Long Sessions

As sessions grow:

1. **Context accumulates** - Old messages pile up
2. **Information becomes stale** - Files change, but context remembers old versions
3. **Focus drifts** - Early task context interferes with current work
4. **Performance drops** - Larger context = slower responses
5. **Costs increase** - Every message resends growing history

## Signs Your Session Is Stale

### Claude references deleted code

```
Claude: "Modify the validateUser function in utils.ts"
You: "I deleted that function an hour ago"
```

### Old variable names appear

```
Claude: "Update the userName variable"
You: "We renamed that to accountId"
```

### Repeated questions

```
Claude: "What framework are you using?"
You: "I told you React three times already"
```

### Conflicting suggestions

Claude suggests patterns that contradict earlier decisions in the same session.

### Slow responses

Response time increases as context bloats.

## When to Start Fresh

### Different task

```
Session 1: Fix login bug
[done]

Session 2: Implement search feature  ← New session
```

Different tasks need different context. Don't carry login bug context into search feature work.

### Significant file changes

If you've made changes outside Claude (in your IDE, via git pull, etc.), Claude's context is outdated.

```bash
git pull  # Significant changes
claude    # Fresh session sees actual current state
```

### After major milestones

```
Completed auth system → Fresh session
Starting payment feature → Clean context
```

### Time gaps

If you step away for 30+ minutes, consider fresh:

```
# Before lunch
claude --session "morning-work"
[work, then lunch]

# After lunch
claude --session "afternoon-work"  ← Fresh
```

### When confused

If Claude seems lost or produces inconsistent output, don't debug the session. Start fresh.

## When to Continue

### Same task, iterating

```
Claude: Here's the implementation
You: Add error handling
Claude: Here's the updated version
You: Now add logging
```

Continuous refinement of the same thing.

### Under 30 minutes

Short sessions rarely have stale context issues.

### Building on previous output

If the next step directly depends on what Claude just produced, continue.

## The Fresh Session Workflow

### 1. Complete the current task

Don't abandon mid-task. Finish or reach a stopping point.

### 2. Commit/save your work

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "Complete auth feature"
```

### 3. Start fresh

```bash
claude --session "new-task-name"
```

### 4. Re-establish context

```
I'm working on the payment feature.
Key files are src/payments/ and src/lib/stripe.ts.
We use React Query for server state.
```

Short context priming is cheaper than carrying stale history.

## Cost Comparison

### Long session (3 hours)

```
Start: 5k tokens
Hour 1: 40k tokens
Hour 2: 80k tokens
Hour 3: 120k tokens

Every message sends 120k tokens of history.
```

### Three fresh sessions (3 hours)

```
Session 1: 5k → 30k tokens (1 hour)
Session 2: 5k → 25k tokens (1 hour)
Session 3: 5k → 20k tokens (1 hour)

Average context: ~25k tokens per message
```

Fresh sessions cost less because context doesn't compound.

## Session Naming Strategy

Name sessions for easy retrieval:

```bash
claude --session "feat-auth-login"
claude --session "fix-payment-webhook"
claude --session "refactor-api-routes"
```

Pattern: `type-area-specific`

Later you can:
```bash
claude sessions list
claude --resume feat-auth-login  # If needed
```

## Handoff Between Sessions

### Ending a session

Before exiting, ask:

```
Summarize what we accomplished and any next steps.
```

Save this summary.

### Starting fresh

Share the summary:

```
Last session we completed X, Y, Z.
Next step is implementing the password reset flow.
The relevant files are...
```

### Use /compact for handoff

```
/compact
```

Then copy the compacted summary for the next session.

## Common Objections

### "But Claude will forget everything"

Good. That "everything" includes stale information. Re-reading current files is better than remembering outdated versions.

### "It's slower to re-explain"

A 30-second context prime costs less than fighting stale context for hours.

### "I lose my conversation history"

Sessions are saved. You can review them. But you shouldn't need to carry old context into new tasks.

## Quick Decision Guide

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| New task | Fresh session |
| Same task, quick iteration | Continue |
| 30+ minutes passed | Fresh session |
| Claude seems confused | Fresh session |
| Major file changes | Fresh session |
| Under 30 minutes, same work | Continue |
| Different area of codebase | Fresh session |

## The Mindset Shift

Don't think of sessions as continuous work streams. Think of them as focused task containers.

```
❌ "I'll use Claude all day in one session"
✅ "I'll use focused sessions for each task"
```

Each session is like a fresh pair of eyes. That's a feature, not a bug.
